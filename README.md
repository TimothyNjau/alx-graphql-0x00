## GraphQuest: Exploring and Implementing Graphql
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It is a powerful alternative to RESTful APIs.
Facebook developed GraphQL and enables clients to specify the structure of the response they need.  
# Key Features
1. Flexible Queries: Clients can query only the data they need.
2. Single Endpoint: All data is retrieved from a single endpoint, unlike REST where each resource typically has its own endpoint.
3. Nested Queries: GraphQL allows nested queries, which means you can fetch related data in a single request.
4. Strong Typing: GraphQL uses a type system to define the schema and enforce the structure of API responses.
